## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

I need to add at least one more media query for certain screens that are smaller vertical pixel layouts. I was using flexbox to center the component both vertically and horizontally, but it was cutting content off on smaller horizontal devices (horizontal tablets).
